Letsfund operates as a decentralized crowdfunding platform dedicated to charitable causes. Whether it's supporting humanitarian projects, funding healthcare initiatives, providing educational resources, or aiding disaster relief efforts, letsfund empowers organizations and individuals to raise funds effectively. The platform assures donors that their contributions are transparent and utilized appropriately, addressing the common concerns regarding the effectiveness of charitable donations.

The `LetsFund.sol` project is a Solidity smart contract that serves as the backbone of a decentralized application (dApp) for charity purposes. It leverages the OpenZeppelin library to ensure secure and standardized development of the contract.
